Some organizations, like the General Services Administration (GSA), require a warning banner with specific, approved language at IT access points to the SmartServer IoT. 

Go to: https://edgedocs.enocean.com/ and search for: `Adding an Access Warning Banner` The files in this folder (`home.png`, and `warningLogo.svg`) are referenced in the documentation portal instructions on how to integrate these files.
