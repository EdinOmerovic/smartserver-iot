# ExportSurvey Utility
--- 
This helper utility processes an XML Subsystem report to summarize the resources needed to fully represent the datapoints in a IzoT CT based network that is to be exported to the SmartServer IoT using `inex.exe`. Armed with this information, the network integrater can gather and preload resources to improve results migrating existing systems to the SmartServer IoT.
